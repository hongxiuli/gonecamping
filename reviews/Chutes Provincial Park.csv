Chutes Provincial Park,André Pelletier,4,Quiet little park. Some campsites backing on residential. Adequate spacing between sites.   Picturesque river but no real place to swim...only good wading for kids.  Off-leash fenced dog park near the water. Adjacent town has basic amenities.
Chutes Provincial Park,D L,5,"We only had an overnight stay at this park, but We loved it. Nice sites, clean bathrooms, good showers, friendly staff. The waterfalls are nice. The swimming area looks good as well although we weren't able to try it on our stay.  This is a nice quiet park."
Chutes Provincial Park,claudia mosher,4,"Beautiful woodsy park that was empty except for our camper, in September 2018.  Mind you, it was raining buckets. Sites were large with wooded verges visually separating the sites. My only downer was having to pay for electricity even though we didn't use any. And the train that loudly whistled by across the river"
Chutes Provincial Park,Christy Brandon,5,"The water at this beach is warm and clean...ideal for little children.
There is a warning for older children who might wander off. Don't. Don't go down river from here. Can't swim there! It's very dangerous to follow this river too near ..."
Chutes Provincial Park,Dan Ursin,5,"Great, flat site with water spigots everywhere. We watched the grounds crew cleaning up sites and they do a great job. Lots of great hiking spots and very clean and easy showers."
Chutes Provincial Park,michel poirier,5,been going to chutes for the last 30 years and always a great time
Chutes Provincial Park,Thomas Telfer,4,"Good for relaxed camping but not if you are looking to escape into the back woods. River swimming and a 6km trail are the highlights for us. Showers are also a plus.

If you're looking to go for a swim, our family always brings a few ..."
Chutes Provincial Park,Emma Lecours,5,Beautiful waterfalls. Nice campground. Really nice main toilet building.
Chutes Provincial Park,Jocelyne Aichwalder,4,Beautiful park but can see city street lights at night ... too close to people's houses
Chutes Provincial Park,Philip Semple,5,This park is a hidden gem. The only thing missing for me are the lack of biking trails. Very clean comfort stations. Good privacy and very nice walking trails. The water was warm but be wary of the river currents.
Chutes Provincial Park,Canadiansugar Angel,4,Nice size campground. Nice swimming area at bottom of the falls which has low and deep areas. Great for families. Wheel chair assesible washroom and campsites. Clean washrooms and showers.Very nice groomed trails. Large lots. Close to little towns and Sudbury.
Chutes Provincial Park,Robyn MacLean May,4,"Really nice park, sites are a nice size. We had plenty of room with our 28ft trailer and pick up truck. Bathrooms are very clean. The mosquitoes were the only bad thing about our stay."
Chutes Provincial Park,Jennifer Turbin,5,Great  Camping... Quite and lots are well spaced out.
Chutes Provincial Park,Tammy Mathieu,5,"Beauty location. Also as a bonus, given its proximity to Massey allows the park to use the municipal water supply, meaning that water does not have to be boiled before drinking.
Beauty trails with great scenery ...especially the falls!!"
Chutes Provincial Park,Lesley Monjezi,4,"The falls are a great place to explore - we spent the whole day there. Campsites were well maintained and a good size. Could hear noise from town, including a party going on at a cottage just on the other side of the fence. Good place for a one or two night stopover on a family trip"
Chutes Provincial Park,Kathleen DeVries,4,"Big treed sites with electrical only. Hot, clean showers and great water pressure  Friendly park staff and beautiful scenery. Highly recommend. We stayed two nights in a 24 foot 5th wheel."
Chutes Provincial Park,Ahmer Nadeem,5,Few hundred meters from trans Canada highway. Nice camp ground close to River and scenic water falls.
Chutes Provincial Park,brianbvm39,4,"Nice park for stop overs....the dumping station needs to have trees cut down so that bigger vehicles can navigate the turn easier and not worry about damage. 
The same goes for getting into some sites....trees need to be removed in order to have a better turning radius....other than that the provincial parks are wonderful"
Chutes Provincial Park,Kevin,4,Beautiful waterfront quiet park
Chutes Provincial Park,Jay David,5,Had a great weekend.
Chutes Provincial Park,Steve Goldberg,4,Nice place to camp for a night or two. Cleanest bathrooms and showers I ever experienced in any government park in North America

Chutes Provincial Park,Eric Addleman,5,Frigid night in mid July but stunning views and quieter than the other parks along Lake Superior
Chutes Provincial Park,Benoit Lafortune,4,"Nice place!
The only downsides are the damn train at night and the power distributor location."

Chutes Provincial Park,Haunter Studios,4,"Camped at this park on my way to Manitoba. I really enjoyed my time here. My campsite was surrounded by beautiful pine trees, which offered a comforting place to stay for the night. I soon found out that a few steps away from my campsite ..."
Chutes Provincial Park,Kate Sciamanna,4,"Great park! It was quiet and peaceful. Staff were always friendly. Amazing trail and waterfalls. Only downside was he beach, expected an actual beach but this was mostly pebbled. Would suggest adding a bit more sand as we had looked forward to swimming and lying on the shore! Everything else was great though."
Chutes Provincial Park,Eric Kaps,5,"Pretty cool place, wish i had more than just a couple hours there. perfect place to take a doggo with ya. Be weary of the rocks near the water, wearing boots I slipped on em like they were made of ice and almost went for a swim"
Chutes Provincial Park,Amanda Drisdelle,4,Great winter hike.  Snowshoes were not needed on this day as the trail has been broken.  Trekking poles are still a good idea with some icy spots.
Chutes Provincial Park,Amy Parsons,5,Great swimming area. Excellent food truck parked near the entrance in the summer that serves 'Indian tacos'. Lovely place to spend the day!
Chutes Provincial Park,Sara Provincial,4,Great park. Nice walking trails and scenery.

Chutes Provincial Park,Kent Wold,4,Good camping facilities with a great waterfall...
Chutes Provincial Park,Foxspot ___________,5,This is a fairly small park with a lot to offer. It has a nice long hiking trail that follows the rapids then loops back around and there is plenty of shade everywhere in the park. The swimming area is a large hole at the bottom of the ...
Chutes Provincial Park,Andrew James,4,"The Chutes is a fun little park! Most parks have a lake with a beach, Chutes has a river with some small rapids you can splash around in.  Lots of large, private campsites, dog use area and some hiking trails.  It's more of a stop-over or stay 2-3 nights type of place."
Chutes Provincial Park,Greg Ronald,4,"Very pretty small park, good clean sites. One of the most beautiful trails past several falls. Great park for a weekend or a 2 or 3 day stopover."
Chutes Provincial Park,Lindsay Reed,5,We had an awesome time here. Our site was close enough to the water falls that you could hear it all day and night which we loved . Natural sound machine ! Our site was also perfectly private so find a location near the falls if you can ...
Chutes Provincial Park,Ian Scott,5,"Nice park, very clean and modern washrooms and showers. The pit toilets were well maintained and didn't smell. Good trails with nice scenery. Park is close to a general store that has many flavours of ice cream and a chip stand."
Chutes Provincial Park,Chris Vigneault,5,A beautiful park!
Chutes Provincial Park,Tamara de Resendes,5,The trails and scenery are absolutely amazing! A very clean and quiet park.  A Definite recommend and we will be back!

Chutes Provincial Park,Waltz,4,"My new favourite camping location! My partner and I stayed in the RF zone and it was so quiet and peaceful! The staff were friendly and helpful, the only reason I docked one star is due to the cleanliness of the bathrooms. I recommend ..."
